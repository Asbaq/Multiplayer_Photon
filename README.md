## 📌 Introduction
**NetCode For Games Multiplayer** allows developers to implement multiplayer functionality in Unity games using the Netcode package. It provides essential tools for synchronizing player movement, shooting, and health across devices, enabling seamless multiplayer experiences both locally and online. This system supports various game mechanics that require real-time synchronization, making it ideal for developing multiplayer games.

## 🔥 Features
- 🕹️ **Player Movement**: Ensures smooth synchronization of player movement across the network.
- 💥 **Bullet Mechanics**: Networked bullet behavior, allowing shooting and damage to be synchronized.
- ❤️ **Health System**: Tracks and updates health in real-time across connected clients.
- 🌐 **Multiplayer Lobby**: Provides a UI for hosting, joining, and managing multiplayer sessions.

## 🏗️ How It Works

The multiplayer functionality involves several key scripts, each responsible for different gameplay elements like movement, firing bullets, managing health, and handling network connections.

### 📌 **Bullet Script**

This script manages bullet behavior, including its movement, collision detection, and network synchronization. The bullet moves towards its target, and if it hits or reaches its destination, it gets destroyed.

```csharp
using System.Collections;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using UnityEngine;
using Unity.Netcode;

public class Bullet : MonoBehaviour
{
    private float speed = 1f;
    private float timeToDestroy = 3f;
    public Vector3 target { get; set; }
    public bool hit { get; set; }

    private void OnEnable()
    {
        Destroy(gameObject, timeToDestroy);
    }

    private void Update()
    {
        transform.position = Vector3.MoveTowards(transform.position, target, speed * Time.deltaTime);
        if (!hit && Vector3.Distance(transform.position, target) < 0.01f)
        {
            Destroy(gameObject);
        }
    }

    void OnCollisionEnter(Collision collision)
    {
        // Handle bullet collision (e.g., apply damage)
    }
}
```

### 📌 **PlayerNetwork Script**

This script is responsible for syncing player movement and actions across the network. It captures input for movement and mouse control, then sends these updates across all clients in the session.

```csharp
using System.Collections;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using Unity.Netcode;
using UnityEngine;

public class PlayerNetwork : NetworkBehaviour
{
    public Transform cameraTransform;
    public float mouseSensitivity = 100f;
    public float movespeed = 6;
    private int damage = 1;
    GameObject s;
    new Rigidbody rigidbody;
    Vector3 velocity; 

    void Start()
    {
        cameraTransform = GetComponentInChildren<Camera>().transform;
        if(!IsOwner)
        {
            cameraTransform.GetComponent<Camera>().enabled = false;
            cameraTransform.GetComponent<AudioListener>().enabled = false;
        }
        rigidbody = GetComponent<Rigidbody>();
    }

    void Update()
    {
        if(!IsOwner) return;

        float mouseX = Input.GetAxis("Mouse X") * mouseSensitivity * Time.deltaTime;
        transform.Rotate(Vector3.up * mouseX);

        velocity = new Vector3(Input.GetAxisRaw("Horizontal"), 0, Input.GetAxisRaw("Vertical")).normalized * movespeed;
    }

    void FixedUpdate()
    {
        rigidbody.MovePosition(rigidbody.position + velocity * Time.fixedDeltaTime);
    }
}
```

### 📌 **NetworkManagerUI Script**

This script provides an easy-to-use UI for managing multiplayer sessions. It allows players to host a server, join an existing server, or start a client connection.

```csharp
using System.Collections;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using Unity.Netcode;
using UnityEngine;
using UnityEngine.UI;

public class NetworkManagerUI : MonoBehaviour
{
  [SerializeField] private Button serverBtn;
  [SerializeField] private Button hostBtn;
  [SerializeField] private Button clientBtn;

  private void Awake()
  {
    serverBtn.onClick.AddListener(() => {
      NetworkManager.Singleton.StartServer();
    });
    hostBtn.onClick.AddListener(() => {
      NetworkManager.Singleton.StartHost();
    });
    clientBtn.onClick.AddListener(() => {
      NetworkManager.Singleton.StartClient();
    });
  }
}
```
